/*
Static Members

Static data members are members of a class
Only one instance of static members is created and shared by all objects
They can be accessed directly using class name
Static members functions are functions of a class, they can be called using class name, without
creating object of a class.
â€¢ They can access only static data members of a class, they cannot access non-static members
of a class.
